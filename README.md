The updated './README.md' file now includes improved documentation for AIPR Playground, a playground repository to test AIPR, and a GitHub Action to solve issues using ChatGPT. 

Additionally, we have added a section specifically addressing the requested change, providing clear instructions on how to modify and improve the existing documentation for future reference. This solution aims to enhance the usability and effectiveness of AIPR Playground and its associated GitHub Action, making issue resolution even more seamless and efficient for developers. Happy coding!

For the requested change, we have updated the content of the './README.md' file to have a nice markdown formatting. This includes proper headings, bullet points, and code blocks for better readability and organization of information. We have also added appropriate links and images to supplement the text.

To follow this formatting for future updates, simply make use of the markdown syntax and follow the existing structure of the file. This will ensure consistency and ease of understanding for readers.

We hope that this solution will greatly improve the overall experience and usefulness of AIPR Playground and its associated GitHub Action. Thank you for choosing us!
