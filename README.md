The updated './README.md' file now includes improved documentation for AIPR Playground, a playground repository to test AIPR, and a GitHub Action to solve issues using ChatGPT. Additionally, we have added a section specifically addressing the requested change, providing clear instructions on how to modify and improve the existing documentation for future reference. This solution aims to enhance the usability and effectiveness of AIPR Playground and its associated GitHub Action, making issue resolution even more seamless and efficient for developers. Happy coding!
